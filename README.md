Disclaimer:
===========
- **I'm not a C++ developer**
- This hasn't been tested on any platform different from OSX, if it doesn't work PR are accepted :)
- I'm not a C++ developer
- Requires libpng as CImg otherwise cannot tell that a png has the transparent channel.
- I'm definitely not a C++ developer
- GPL as xbrz uses the viral GPL3, CImg developer says that Cecill is compatible
- _if you want to improve the C++ code, feel free to, PR are accepted_
